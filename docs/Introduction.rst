Introduction

Why pyMAP?
----------
This is a very interesting question that desevered to be answered properly. All 450K platform analysis software developed so far are made using R.
While we think R is a power statistical platform, we also believe in diversity of analysis platforms. Python, which is a powerful language can also be used for these analysis.
pyMAP, implemented in native python, offers a more powerful alternative which utilizes python scripts and can also be modified further.
